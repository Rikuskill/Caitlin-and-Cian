A game Caitlin thought up.

Player is in a canoe, paddling into ever thickening fog and occasionally working past puzzling obstacles and snagging objects out of the water to progress. 
Along the way, Player picks up a Bird Girl that joins them in their canoe, sitting in the back seat and helping row when she isn't slacking. 
Player from here onward must balance getting help rowing the now heavier canoe 
with the Bird Girl's tendency to fly into a supernatural rage if reprimanded too frequently.
